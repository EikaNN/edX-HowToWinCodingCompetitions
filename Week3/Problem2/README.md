# Inversions

Recall that an inversion in a sequence of numbers A is a situation when *i* < *j*, but *A<sub>i</sub>* > *A<sub>j</sub>*.

Given a sequence of integers, your task is to count the number of inversions in it.

Hint: to make it faster, you may adapt the mergesort algorithm to solve this problem.

## Input

The ﬁrst line of the input ﬁle contains an integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>) – the number of elements in the sequence. The sequence itself follows in the second line. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed 10<sup>9</sup> by the absolute value.

## Output

Output the number of inversions in the ﬁrst and only line of the output ﬁle.
