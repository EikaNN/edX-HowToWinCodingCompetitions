# Saving Lives

Dr. Garin is going to a remote village to save some lives. He has a suitcase which can accomodate at most *W* units of medicine. However, different types of medicine have different efficiency. In total, he has *N* different types of medicine. A single unit of the *i*-th type can save *A<sub>i</sub>* lives. However, the supply of each medicine is limited: the doctor has only *B<sub>i</sub>* units of the *i*-th type of medicine.

How many lives can the doctor save?

## Input

The first line of the input file contains *N* (1 ≤ *N* ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>), the number of different types of medicine. The following *N* lines contain descriptions of these types. Each such line contains two integers, *A<sub>i</sub>* and *B<sub>i</sub>* (1 ≤ *A<sub>i</sub>*,*B<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 100).

The last line contains *W* (1 ≤ *W* ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).
